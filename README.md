# Flashy ðŸ”¦

Flashy is a simple 2D game. You have to pick up items to survive and avoid contact with enemies.
But be careful. You are just equipped with a flashlight to light up the maze.

## Rules

 - Find the turquoise treasure to stay alive and gain points
 - Don't touch the violet agents
 - On each pick up a treasure, 2 more agents spawn and all agents are getting a little faster

## Background

Flashy emerged from a coding challenge and was developed into a game. With the game I wanted to gain some experience with 2D-Ray-Casting and Steering-Behaviors. 
Special thanks goes to Danial Shiffman for the great coding videos, the code base and the inspiration for this project.
