# Flashy

Flashy is a simple 2D game. You have to pick up the green items to survive and avoid contact with the red agents.
But be careful. You are just equiped with a flashlight to enlight the maze.

## Background

Flashy emerged from a coding challenge and was developed into a game. With the game I wanted to gain some experience with 2D-Ray-Casting and Steering-Behaviours. 
Special thanks goes to Danial Shiffman for the great coding videos, the code base and the inspiration for this project.
